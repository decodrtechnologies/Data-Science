# Olympic Analysis:

This repository is about the Olympic Analysis in which analysis and visualization of the dataset consisting both the summer and winter games data is performed. Which Olympic athletes have the most gold medals? Which countries are they from and how has it changed over time?
More than 35,000 medals have been awarded at the Olympics since 1896. The first two Olympiads awarded silver medals and an olive wreath for the winner, and the IOC retrospectively awarded gold, silver, and bronze to athletes based on their rankings.

The dataset consists of various columns like "Year", "City", "Sport", "Discipline", "Athlete", "Country", "Gender" to name a few.It includes a row for every Olympic athlete that has won a medal since the first games. Data was provided by the IOC Research and Reference Service and published by The Guardian's Datablog.
