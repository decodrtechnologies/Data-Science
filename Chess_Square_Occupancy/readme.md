# Occupancy of Squares in Game of Chess
## Problem Statement

Lots of information is contained within a single chess game, let alone a full dataset of multiple games. It is primarily a game of patterns, and data science is all about detecting patterns in data, which is why chess has been one of the most invested in areas of AI in the past. The dataset 'games.csv' collects all of the information available from 20,000 games. The aim is to analyse the occupancy of each square on the chess board so as the predict the most important squares in the game of Chess which might help the player to win the game.
