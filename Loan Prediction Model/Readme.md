## Problem Statement:
The dataset contains basic information about some loan applicants to a bank. Based on Machine Learning techniques we are going to determine whether the bank will proceed to sanction loan to that applicant or not. Also, we are going to show how different machine learning models can improve the prediction just by doing simple process on the data.
